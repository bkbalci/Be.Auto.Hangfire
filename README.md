## Overview


**Be.Auto.Hangfire.Dashboard.RecurringJobManager** is a specialized library for managing recurring jobs in Hangfire-based projects. It allows you to configure and manage various types of jobs, including method calls and web requests, directly from the Hangfire Dashboard. This enables all job management tasks to be handled through the dashboard interface without needing to manually add jobs in code.


## Key Features

- **Automatic Type and Method Detection**: Automatically detects types and methods within the projectâ€™s assembly, allowing you to input parameters directly through the Hangfire Dashboard.
- **Dependency Injection (DI) Support**: Types registered with DI are automatically resolved.
- **Comprehensive Job Management**: Supports MethodCall and WebRequestJob types, with full control over job creation, editing, and deletion through the dashboard.
- **HTTP Request Jobs**: Allows detailed configuration of HTTP requests, including headers, body, and query parameters, directly through the dashboard. It also prevents collisions by avoiding the duplication of jobs with identical parameters.

## Installation

1. **Add the NuGet Package**:
   Install the `Be.Auto.Hangfire.Dashboard.RecurringJobManager` package to your project:
   ```bash
   Install-Package Be.Auto.Hangfire.Dashboard.RecurringJobManager
   ```

2. **Configure Services**:
   In your `Startup.cs`, add the following configuration:
   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddHangfire(config => config
           .UseSqlServerStorage(Configuration.GetConnectionString("HangfireConnection"))
           .UseDashboardRecurringJobManager(option =>
           {
               option.AddAppDomain(AppDomain.CurrentDomain);
               option.DisableConcurrentlyJobExecution();
               option.WebRequestJobTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15));
           }));

       services.AddHangfireServer();
   }
   ```
